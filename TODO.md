add instructions how to use this to the README.md

log the iperf runs to a tmp directory and collect performance metrics in a csv:

* unixtime: start of run, unixtime: end of run, mbits: throughput, megabytes: number of bytes transmitted

this csv can then be analyzed and worked by our marketing for case studies and nice graphs, describing the number of concurrent iperf runs, gws and hypervisors used for producing these numbers
